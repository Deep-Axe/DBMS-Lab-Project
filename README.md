# DBMS-Lab-Project
InfraVision is a platform for real-time infrastructure monitoring and automated task management. It provides live performance tracking, instant alerts, and a structured incident management system to improve efficiency and reduce downtime.

Project Overview: 

 

Purpose: 

 
Modern IT infrastructure management has become increasingly complex, with organizations facing critical challenges in maintaining system health and operational efficiency. The current landscape is characterized by fragmented monitoring approaches, manual interventions, and limited visibility into system performance. These challenges result in increased operational costs, reduced system reliability, and potential security vulnerabilities. 

 

Project Objectives: 

 

InfraVision aims to address these challenges through a comprehensive approach: 

Develop an integrated platform for holistic infrastructure monitoring 

Create a centralized system for automated task management 

Implement real-time performance tracking and alerting 

Establish a robust incident management workflow. 

 

Scope and Purpose 

The project seeks to create a comprehensive systems monitoring toolkit that provides: 

Multi-site infrastructure management capabilities 

Proactive system health monitoring 

Automated routine administrative tasks 

Actionable insights for IT teams 

Continuous compliance and security tracking
